          By default, all libraries are included in the feed results.<br/>
          If you want to limit the results to certain libraries, select those 
          libraries from the list and click &quot;Include Selected&quot;.<br/>
          If you want to exclude certain libraries from the results, select those 
          libraries from the list and click &quot;Exclude Selected&quot;.<br/>
          &quot;Include Selected&quot; and &quot;Exclude Selected&quot; are naturally 
          exclusive:<br/>
          If you limit the feed to , e.g., Arts and Music, all other libraries 
          will be excluded; if you exclude Science and Engineering, all other 
          libraries will be included.<br>
